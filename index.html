            In 1990, Wigwe received the British council scholarship to study at the University College of North Wales
            (now Bangor University), earning a Master of Arts in banking and finance in 1991.[1] He later earned a MSc

          <h1 id="third-div-title">CAREER</h1>
          <h5 id="third-div-text">
            Wigwe started his career at Coopers & Lybrand as a management consultant in the late 1980s, becoming a
            chartered accountant in 1989. He later joined Guaranty Trust Bank, where he worked for over a decade and
            eventually became executive director around 1998.
            In 2002, Wigwe and his business partner Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede bought Access Bank. Their purchase was
            delayed
            over the Central Bank of Nigeria's concerns the pair were too young to own a bank. Between 2002 and 2017,
            the
            bank grew to become the 4th largest bank in Nigeria. Between 2002 and 2014 he served as the company's
            deputy
            managing director.Wigwe also served as the chairman of Access Bank Ghana Limited starting in 2013. From
            January 2014 until his death, he was CEO and group managing director of Access Bank.

            In 2018 Access Bank merged with competitor Diamond Bank, making it the largest bank in Nigeria.[9] He had
            planned to expand the bank into Asia in early 2024, but died before any expansion officially launched.[9]

          <h1 id="third-div-title">DEATH</h1>
          <h5 id="third-div-text">
            Wigwe was among six people who died on 9 February 2024 after the Eurocopter EC130 in which they were

            The remains of Wigwe and his family were repatriated to Nigeria, where they were buried in his hometown in
            Isiokpo, Rivers State, on 9 March, following a week-long wake in Lagos that was attended by several

            road
            leading to his oil refinery in his honor.
